# üéì Student Course Management System ‚Äî PostgreSQL Project

A PostgreSQL-based database management system to manage students, courses, and enrollments with added functionality for **CRUD operations**, **Joins**, **Views**, **Aggregation**, and **Advanced SQL queries**.

---

## üìå Project Description

This project implements a relational database for a student-course enrollment system using PostgreSQL. It models three primary entities: `students`, `courses`, and `enrollments`. The database captures student data, course offerings, and enrollment/grade records.

It's designed to practice and demonstrate:

- **Relational schema design**
- **Complex queries with joins and aggregations**
- **Views and triggers**
- **PostgreSQL JSONB & ARRAY usage**
- **Data manipulation through CRUD**
- **Advanced Queries**

## ‚úçÔ∏è CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Insert new student, course, or enrollment records
- **Read**: View student/course details, search by criteria
- **Update**: Modify student age, course details, grades, etc.
- **Delete**: Remove enrollments or student/course records

## üìö Learning Outcomes

- PostgreSQL table design with **JSONB** and **arrays**
- CRUD operations through SQL
- Writing and optimizing **JOIN**, **VIEW**, and **AGGREGATE** queries
- Creating and using **triggers**
- Real-world **database modeling**
